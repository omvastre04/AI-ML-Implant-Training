Description :
  We have developed a console based project for McDonald's franchise owner's mainly for invoice generation and to maintain record.
  On first time execution it will ask for Seller Info. Enter It Correctly.
  Then you will aee welcome window in that you can see options to add item, create bill, see records and exit.
  In add items, you can see available items and their rates, and you can add more items, delete item and also modify them.
  In create invoice, it will show current envoice no, date time, then you have to enter customer details, and products brought. Meanwhile you can see invoice preview, delete items in invoice and discard bill.
  In history option, you will see no of invoices enrolled, and it will ask for no of invoice you want to see or name of customer. If you enter name of customer it will show invoices available by that particular customer name. Then you have to enter no of invoice which you want to see.
For More Understanding Refer MiniProject.png (for frontend design) and MiniProject.xlsx (for backend).

Note : On first time execution of program, connect to localhost (Apache and MySQL Server via XAMPP), change user and password in code. Then on excution, it will ask for Seller Details. Enter details correctly, it can't be changed.
